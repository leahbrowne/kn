# St Kitts Tourism PWA Demo (Skeleton)

This repository currently ships a static HTML shell so the Vercel deployment
pipeline can be validated while the full Next.js experience is built.

## Local Preview

Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Vercel Deployment

Create a new Vercel project pointing at this repository. The default settings
will deploy the static site automatically.

## Next Steps

- Replace the static shell with the planned Next.js 14 App Router build.
- Add PWA support, personalization, and trip planning.
